      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="font-size: large; color: black">
        I am Aditya Singh, currently pursuing B.Tech at Walchand Institute of
        Technology, with a strong passion for front-end development. I have
        honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have experience
        working with frameworks like React.js. My background includes developing
        responsive, user-friendly websites and collaborating on team projects to
        create seamless user interfaces. I am eager to bring my problem-solving
        skills and enthusiasm for continuous learning to innovative projects and
        grow as a front-end developer.
