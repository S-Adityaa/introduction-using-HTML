# Cross-Platform Mobile Programming Course - HTML/CSS Assignment

Welcome to the HTML/CSS review assignment! In this exercise, you will be working on a simple web page to demonstrate your understanding of HTML and CSS. You are allowed flexibility in your answers, but please make sure to complete all instructions.

## Instructions

### HTML Instructions

1. Initialize an HTML document. Change the browser tab text to `{Your_name_here}'s Web Page`.
2. Link to the external CSS file.
3. Create the "body" of your page, and use a header tag to add a title.
4. Tell us a bit about yourself! Include at least one paragraph, and at least one example of inline styling.
5. Tell us the top three questions or comments you may have about class thus far. Make sure to list them in an ordered fashion.
6. Did you know you could insert pictures into HTML? Display any picture you'd like below the list!
7. We'd like our friends who use assistive technologies to still enjoy your picture. Add some "alt" text, describing the image.
8. We want to be able to see all the great code you push to Github. Create a footer, and add some text or an image that links to your Github.
9. Great job! This is all the HTML you'll need for now.

### CSS Instructions

1. White is a great color, but it's too bright to look at during the night time! Change the background of your entire site using a global selector.
2. Black is a cool color, but it's hard to see on this background. Change the color of your website title to something new!
3. The paragraphs and lists you added look great! However, your new background doesn't match :( Change the font of your text in the body, and the text color as well.
4. We want to be able to see the text on your web page on our massive monitors. Move all the text to the center of your web page!
5. Unfortunately, our eyesight is poor. Can you apply any sort of color to any inline styling on your HTML page?
6. Great! This looks really good. But it feels really cramped. Can you add some padding to the margins of your page?

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the completeness of the instructions provided. While you have flexibility in how you respond, make sure that you follow all the instructions accurately.

## Submitting Your Work

After completing your work, remember to upload your commit hash to the Canvas quiz. Here's a small guide on how to find and copy your commit hash:

1. Open the terminal or Git GUI.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run `git log`.
4. Find the commit hash corresponding to your assignment (it's a long string of numbers and letters).
5. Copy and paste this hash into the Canvas quiz.

Please don't hesitate to ask for assistance if you need help with this process.

Good luck, and happy coding!
